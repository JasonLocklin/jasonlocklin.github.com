Welcome to my Github "pages" page. I have several public repositories 
here. One of them builds my 
[Academic Webpage](http://artsweb.uwaterloo.ca/~jalockli), which has
all my contact information.
I also have a [wiki](https://github.com/JasonLocklin/jasonlocklin.github.com/wiki)
for collecting notes and short write-ups. I do have a 
[blog](http://freeknowledge.wordpress.com/) elsewhere, but I'll 
be migrating it here when I get a chance.

Feel free to poke around. I'm in the process of moving a lot of my stuff
to git in order make publishing open access (including experiment and 
analysis code) more fluid and transparent.
