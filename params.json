I do have a \r\n[blog](http://freeknowledge.wordpress.com/) elsewhere, but I'll \r\nbe migrating it here when I get a chance.\r\n\r\nFeel free to poke around. I'm in the process of moving a lot of my stuff\r\nto git in order make publishing open access (including experiment and \r\nanalysis code) more fluid and transparent. \r\n\r\nJason Locklin,\r\nUniversity of Waterloo.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
